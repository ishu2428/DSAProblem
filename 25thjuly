//Level order traversal in spiral form
Given a binary tree and the task is to find the spiral order traversal of the tree.

Spiral order Traversal mean: Starting from 
level 0 for root node, for all the even 
levels we print the node's value from right to left and
 for all the odd levels we print the node's value from left to right. 

Input:
           10
         /     \
        20     30
      /    \
    40     60
Output: 10 20 30 60 40
