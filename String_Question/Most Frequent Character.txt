Given a string s of lowercase alphabets. The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string s. If more than one character occurs the maximum number of times then print the lexicographically smaller character.

Examples:

Input: s = "testsample"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: e is the character which is having the highest frequency.
Input: s = "output"
Output: 't'
Explanation:  t and u are the characters with the same frequency, but t is lexicographically smaller.

Code:-

class Solution {
    // Function to find the maximum occurring character in a string.
    public static char getMaxOccuringChar(String str) {
        int store[]=new int[26];
        int max=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        char ch=' ';
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++)
        {
            store[str.charAt(i)-'a']++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
        {
            if(max<store[i])
            {
                max=store[i];
                ch=(char)('a'+i);
            }
        }
        return ch;
    }
}
