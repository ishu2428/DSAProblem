Palindrome String

You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
Input: s = "acbca"
Output: true
Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

Code:-

class Solution {
    boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
        int st=0;
        int end=str.length()-1;
        while(st<end)
        {
            if(str.charAt(st)!=str.charAt(end))
            {
                return false;
            }
            st++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
