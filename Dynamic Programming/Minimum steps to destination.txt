Minimum steps to destination


Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, you must take i steps. Given a destination d, find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Example 1:

Input: d = 2
Output: 3
Explaination: The steps taken are +1, -2 and +3.
Example 2:

Input: d = 10
Output: 4
Explaination: The steps taken are +1, +2, +3 and +4.

    static int minSteps(int d) 
    {
        int step=0;
        int sum=0;
        while(sum<d || (sum-d)%2!=0)
        {
            step++;
            sum=sum+step;
        }
        return step;
        
    }
